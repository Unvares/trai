          <p>
            Welcome to Trash Recycling AI (TRAI)! We're on a mission to
            revolutionize waste management and promote recycling through
            education and engagement.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The world faces a critical waste management challenge, with only a
            fraction of global waste being recycled. Our inspiration comes from
            the urgent need highlighted by the United Nations for enhanced waste
            management practices to combat pollution, climate change, and
            financial losses.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            One of the key issues we're addressing is improper waste separation,
            a significant contributor to inefficient recycling. Studies reveal
            that lack of knowledge, accessibility to recycling facilities, and
            perceived inconvenience hinder proper waste sorting. Our goal is to
            make recycling education accessible, engaging, and effortless.
          </p>

            TRAI is a web-based application powered by AI chatbots, offering
            rapid and interactive education on waste disposal. Through quizzes,
            playful gamification, and informative content, we aim to empower
            individuals with the knowledge and motivation to recycle correctly.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Unlike traditional solutions, TRAI minimizes deployment and
            maintenance costs while ensuring scalability. By leveraging custom
            GPTs, our platform can adapt to different waste separation rules and
            cater to diverse user needs.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Join us in our mission to create a world where recycling is second
            nature, and waste becomes a valuable resource. Together, let's build
            a cleaner, greener future with TRAI.
