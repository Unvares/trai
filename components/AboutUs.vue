      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Trash Recycling AI (TRAI)! We're on a mission to 
        revolutionize waste management and promote recycling through 
        education and engagement.</p><br>
      <p>The world faces a critical waste management challenge, with 
        only a fraction of global waste being recycled. Our inspiration 
        comes from the urgent need highlighted by the United Nations 
        for enhanced waste management practices to combat pollution, 
        climate change, and financial losses.</p><br>
      <p>One of the key issues we're addressing is improper waste 
        separation, a significant contributor to inefficient recycling. 
        Studies reveal that lack of knowledge, accessibility to recycling 
        facilities, and perceived inconvenience hinder proper waste 
        sorting. Our goal is to make recycling education accessible, 
        engaging, and effortless.</p><br>
      <p>TRAI is a web-based application powered by AI chatbots, offering
        rapid and interactive education on waste disposal. Through 
        quizzes, playful gamification, and informative content, we aim 
        to empower individuals with the knowledge and motivation to 
        recycle correctly.</p><br>
      <p>Unlike traditional solutions, TRAI minimizes deployment and 
        maintenance costs while ensuring scalability. By leveraging 
        custom GPTs, our platform can adapt to different waste separation 
        rules and cater to diverse user needs.</p><br>
      <p>Join us in our mission to create a world where recycling is 
        second nature, and waste becomes a valuable resource. Together, 
        let's build a cleaner, greener future with TRAI. </p>
