# TRAI
This project began as a small experiment to improve waste sorting on the Linnaeus University campus, exploring how AI could enhance digital transformation in everyday settings. It was later presented at the [International Symposium on Digital Transformations, Linnaeus University, Sweden](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rokmanis_research-innovation-digitaltransformation-activity-7240277162748981248-TKOH) and the [Innovation Club, European University of Tirana](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amanda-kote-3b07bb18b_innovation-ai-recycling-activity-7255295814917390338-6oML).

The idea sparked some early interest during presentations, but conversations with government and waste management contacts showed little demand for a campus-focused solution. There was some curiosity from recycling centers, but need was unclear and the potential to scale was limited. The project’s real-world impact looked small, so it was ultimately discontinued.

An abstract based on the project was published in the conference's _Book of Abstracts_ and is available for download [here](https://open.lnu.se/index.php/isdt/article/download/4652/4138).

The repository has been made public so others can explore, learn from, or reuse the code if it’s useful for their own projects.
